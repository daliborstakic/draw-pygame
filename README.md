# Drawing App
## What I've done
The program is really basic and it gives you the main aspects of almost every drawing program. You can choose between four colors using the keyboard presses:
* Red **(The R key)**
* Blue **(The B key)**
* Green **(The G key)**
* Yellow **(The Y key)**
* Black **(The D key)**

You can draw using the left mouse button, and erase using the right mouse button. One more prominent feature is the ability to increase the thickness of the brush. You can increase it using the **Equals** key and decrease it using the **Minus** key. You can also clear the screen using the **C** key.
**UPDATE**: Program now includes color buttons so you can easily change colors. The clear key and the brush thickness keys stay the same.

## What I hope to implement
*I'll be implementing a UI which will greatly reduce the amount of friction and simplify the design.* **This change was implemented.**
